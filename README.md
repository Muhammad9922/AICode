# Maze Solver

## Introduction

Maze Solver is a Python-based program that uses various search algorithms to find paths in mazes. It supports Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS).

## Features

- Multiple search algorithms: BFS, DFS, GBFS
- Visualization of the maze-solving process
- Customizable maze environments
- Error handling for common issues (e.g., multiple agents, no goals, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/maze-solver.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd maze-solver
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the program:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Choose a search algorithm (BFS, DFS, GBFS).
3. Watch the maze-solving process, and view the visualization.
