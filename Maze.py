        Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) is a graph traversal algorithm used for pathfinding, particularly in
        scenarios where a heuristic can guide the search. Unlike traditional search algorithms, GBFS prioritizes
        nodes based on heuristic evaluations. The algorithm maintains a priority queue, selecting nodes with the
        lowest heuristic values, indicating their proximity to the goal. GBFS continues to expand nodes until the
        goal is reached or the entire space is explored. While GBFS may not guarantee optimality, its efficiency
        relies on the quality of the heuristic function. When the heuristic accurately estimates the true cost,
        GBFS can quickly find solutions. Notably applied in route planning, robotics, and games, GBFS is part of the
        family of informed search algorithms, offering an effective approach to navigating large state spaces.
